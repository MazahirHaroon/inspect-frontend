# Inspect Frontend – Web Development Foundations

Welcome to the **Inspect Frontend Learning Repository!**  
This repository contains the **daily code, class examples, and mini projects** from our live sessions and learner discussions.

We focus on helping students **build strong foundations in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, the essential building blocks of modern frontend development.  
Every folder here connects directly to what we’ve discussed and built together during our calls.

> 🟢 We’re just getting started!  
> For now, you’ll find only a few files as we’re actively adding new lessons each week.  
> Check back often for updates or star the repo to stay notified.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into dedicated folders for different learning paths and teaching formats:

### `/javascript_courses`
This folder focuses on **core JavaScript concepts**, taught progressively day by day.  
Each subfolder or file corresponds to a daily session covering key topics such as:

- DOM manipulation  
- Events and forms  
- Arrays, objects, and loops  
- Functions and modules  
- Building small interactive examples  

It’s designed to help learners gain strong fundamentals before moving on to larger frameworks or projects.

### `/reporters-desk`
This folder represents our **project-based learning series**, where we apply all the JavaScript concepts to build a complete, real-world web application — *Reporter’s Desk*.  
It’s a newsroom workflow app that helps learners connect core programming skills with practical product thinking.  
Each subfolder (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) represents a step in building the application from scratch, first with vanilla JavaScript and later transitioning to React.

### `/ObjectAndArrays`

This folder introduces a **new foundational mini-series** focused on understanding **Objects and Arrays** in JavaScript through relatable, real-world examples.

The current subfolder, `LibraryManagementSystem`, walks learners through how data can be structured, accessed, and manipulated in JavaScript applications using objects and arrays.

Each day builds on the previous one with progressive improvements:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Objects and Arrays through a simple “Library Borrow System.”
Learners understand how to store and update information inside objects and arrays dynamically.

- **Day 2**: Extends functionality with a “Return Book” feature, teaching how to remove items from arrays using .splice() and update the DOM accordingly.

- (Upcoming Days) will include features like counting available books, tracking returned items, and visualizing library statistics — gradually connecting core data concepts to real UI interactions.

**Learning Goal:**
> Help learners intuitively grasp how **objects store related data** and how **arrays manage collections of those data units**, all through a practical, story-driven example rather than abstract code snippets.

### YouTube Learning Series

We also maintain a separate **YouTube video series**, where similar (but sometimes broader) topics are explained in a structured, asynchronous way.  
While the **JavaScript folder** follows our live sessions and practical exercises,  
the **YouTube lessons** are meant for independent learners who want to revisit or learn at their own pace.

Together, these three parts — **concept-based learning**, **project-based application**, and **video reinforcement** — ensure a complete, layered understanding of frontend development.
