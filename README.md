# Inspect Frontend – Web Development Foundations

Welcome to the **Inspect Frontend Learning Repository!**  
This repository contains the **daily code, class examples, and mini projects** from our live sessions and learner discussions.

We focus on helping students **build strong foundations in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, the essential building blocks of modern frontend development.  
Every folder here connects directly to what we’ve discussed and built together during our calls.

> 🟢 We’re just getting started!  
> For now, you’ll find only a few files as we’re actively adding new lessons each week.  
> Check back often for updates or star the repo to stay notified.

## 🎓 Weekly Classes

We conduct **weekly frontend learning sessions**, usually on **Friday evenings (8:30 PM – 9:30 PM)**.

These sessions include:

- Concept discussions
- Live coding
- Q&A based on student doubts

Sometimes, when learners request (especially before exams or holidays), we also hold **continuous weekday sessions** to help them progress faster.

## 🎥 Learn Asynchronously via YouTube

Alongside our live calls, we also maintain a [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@mazahirharoon) where we upload **separate recorded videos** explaining the same concepts discussed in our sessions, but in a more structured, self-paced format.

These are **not call recordings**, but freshly recorded lessons made to help learners **revisit or catch up** on topics anytime.

## 🧠 How This Content is Created

Every piece of content here — from a simple function to a full project — is **inspired by real discussions** with learners.  
When a student asks a “why” or “how” question, that often becomes:

- a new code example in this repo
- a detailed note in AnyNote
- or a video topic on YouTube

This makes the project **organic and community-driven**, built by the learners, for the learners.
